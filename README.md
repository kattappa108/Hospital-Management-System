# Hospital-Management-System
Technologies Used: Java, MySQL, JDBC, SQL, MySQL Workbench

1. Designed and implemented a console-based application to manage core hospital operations including patient registration, doctor listings, and appointment scheduling, ensuring a smooth user flow through a menu-driven interface.

2. Developed modular Java classes (Patient, Doctor, Appointment) with robust input validation, error handling, and dynamic interaction with a MySQL database using JDBC.

3. Integrated complex SQL queries (joins, inserts, and deletes) to enable real-time booking, listing, and deletion of appointments while ensuring data consistency and doctor availability.

4. Configured and managed MySQL Workbench backend with structured tables for patients, doctors, and appointments, and leveraged PreparedStatement to enhance security and prevent SQL injection.
